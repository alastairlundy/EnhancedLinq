# EnhancedLinq.MsExtensions Methods

Deferred Execution extensions perform the relevant operation(s) upon the relevant enumerable being enumerated. Examples of LINQ's built in deferred execution extensions are ``Select``, ``GroupBy``, and ``Where``.

Immediate Execution extensions perform the relevant operation(s) immediately. Examples of LINQ's built in immediate mode extensions are ``IndexOf``, ``Any``, ``All``, and ``Count``.
